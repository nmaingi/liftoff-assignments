### Overview
I want to build an application that suggests what to eat based on several factors. I came up with this idea from the countless of times 
I have been with a friend or by myself and just could not decide what I felt like eating. The app will use the users mood, factor in the
temperature outside and the season, time of day and if they are stressed or not.

At first it will suggest based on cusine type e.g Mexican, American e.t.c but over time, from learning if the suggestion was good from feedback
the user gives, the suggestions will get more accurate and features with the standard dishes in each cuisine will be added.
